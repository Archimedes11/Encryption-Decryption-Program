# Encryption-Decryption-Program

This progam was designed to take a .ppm picture file and encrypt a message into it by slightly manipulating the RGB values of the pixels.
The program encrpyts a message into a .ppm picture file without visually changing the picture.
The progam can then decrypt an encypted message from the picture file.
